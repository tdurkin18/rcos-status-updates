## Last Week's Accomplishments
	I began implementing my user feedback to the venue files. I have the feedback popping up but I am having trouble reverting the user to the submissions page after they close the pop-up. I should be about to just reroute the user to the correct page when they close the pop-up, but this button is made withing the library and not the html file. I am going to try to make my own close button. Also, i did not install the libraries I just copied the https link to a script tag.
## This Week's Plan

I hope to finish my implementation this week.

## Anything Blocking?

I am having trouble installing the libraries to venue.
