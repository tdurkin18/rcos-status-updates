## Last Week's Accomplishments

	Last week I was able to finish learning about angular, which was my goal for the week. Throughout the last few sections of the tutorial I learned about services and routing. Services are an important part to angular because they all classes to share information. Routing tells the webpage which view to display when the user clicks a link on the page. The forRoot() allows for this navigation because it supplies the providers and directives needed for routing.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to finish learning about how to apply mongodb so I can begin to work on bugs.
