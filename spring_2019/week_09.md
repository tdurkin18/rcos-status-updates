## Last Week's Accomplishments
	This week I was able to implement user feedback with a popup. When the user submits their photo for the event, a popup shows presenting the user with a preview of what they are submitting. They can chose to either cancel their submission or send it to be verified by the instructor. After the submission, they are taken to a screen which shows all their submissions. Before I implemented this feature, the user would be taken to a blank page which said "Submission sent". I decided to use Bootstrap modals instead of using SweetAlert. This was because the buttons used in SweetAlert were built into the library and could not be altered. With a Bootstrap modal I could pair it with JavaScript to trigger the popup manually. If the user does not fill in all the required fields then the popup will not show.

## This Week's Plan
