## Last Week's Accomplishments
	This week I was assigned an enhancement, adding feedback after a user uploads their picture. I began looking at javascript alert libraries to determine which one would be best to use. I determined Sweet Alert was the best. First, I wanted to play around with sweet alert before I started coding within the venue files. Once the user clicks the submit button, there should be an alert that tells them their submission was processed. I created a submit demo button that, when clicked, displays the student's submitted picture and tells them that their submission was successful. When I implement this alert into venue, the student should be brought back to their dashboard when the alert is closed. Right now, after a submission, the website brings you to a pointless page so this alert should improve flow and provide feedback.

## This Week's Plan

I hope to add the demo alert I created to venue with the features described.
