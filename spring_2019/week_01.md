## Last Week's Accomplishments

	The past two weeks I have spent my time learning JavaScript and Angular. I have fully completed the JavaScript tutorial and have a good understanding of the fundamentals. Throughout the JavaScript tutorial I learned the basic syntax, different ways to create objects, and web API's just to name a few. I am still a little confused on API's so I would like to review them when I finish the Angular tutorial. 
	I am about half way through the Angular tutorial. So far I have learned how to create and display components by alerting the css, ts, and html files. In order to display something from a typescript file we must double curly braces which is interpolation binding. Also, if we want the user to be able to change something we displayed, we need to user [(ngModel)] which allows for two way data binding.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to finish the angular tutorial and begin learning about MongoDB. Also, I would like to review javascript API's and closures.
