## Last Week's Accomplishments
	This week I was able to solve my first bug. After completing my documentation of the files I was working with I was able to understand what was going on a little better. I was able to see that I did not need to add a controller file for the submission card because there was a variable within the submissionCard.directive that represented the controller. I added a check in here to see whether the user was an instructor or not.

## This Week's Plan

This I plan to work through the issues marked on github.
