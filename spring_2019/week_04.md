## Last Week's Accomplishments
	Last week I completed my goal of learning how to apply mongodb by creating a simple web application using the mean stack. I watched a tutorial on youtube on how to build a mean stack application so I could learn how all the technologies work with each other. The application had simple functions such as add and removing a person's contact information from a database. First the database was created using node and express to allow for contacts to be added and removed from the database as well as create the routing to allow for this. Angular was used to pull data from out api and add functionality so the user could add and delete contacts.
	

## This Week's Plan

This week I will begin to read through the source code so I can work on my first bug.
