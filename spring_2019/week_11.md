## Last Week's Accomplishments
	This was a pretty productive semester for me. Since this was my time taking RCOS, I was new to the Venue project. I started off by doing tutorials so that I could learn all the technologies in the MEAN Stack. Some of the tutorials I did were JavaScript and Angular tutorials because these are the main technologies I would be working with. Throughout this tutorials I created demo apps to show my progress which can be seen on my github. 
	Now that I learned how the MEAN Stack worked, I was able to start working on issues. The first issue I fixed was students being able to verify their own submissions. This was a pretty easy fix once I read through the files because I just need to add an authentication check for whether the current user was a student or instructor. The next issue I fixed was student were not able to be verified into a class. After looking through the files were the issue was, it was deemed that this was a backend error and not a frontend as it was marked on github. For this I had to learn how the backend communicated with the frontend to add a student to the database. This issue was a lot harder to solve because all the correct seemed correct. After searching up multiple errors on google and logging the student info trying to be added to the database, I found out the push function could not be used in our version. Therefore, I used the concat function to add the student to the database. The last thing I worked on, the submission pop-up, is a quality of life feature. This pop-up displays to the student their submission so that they can make sure they are submitting the correct info. This pop-up uses a Bootstrap modal. I also added JavaScript so that the modal is triggered manually and the pop-up only appears when all the fields are filled in. I still have a small issue with this that I cannot figure out: there is a confusion between the .less and css I used which messes up the header on the upload page only. 
	I believe I learned a lot of new technologies this semester because of the things I worked as described above. This was a fun learning experience and I will continue to work on venue in the coming semesters.
