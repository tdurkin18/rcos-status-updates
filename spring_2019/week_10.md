## Last Week's Accomplishments
	This week I prepared my slide for the presentation on Friday. Also, I submitted my demos that I created earlier in the semester to my github. I had two demos that helped me learn angular. One was the tutorial from angular.io and the other was a custom one I built to test my understanding.

## This Week's Plan

Finish submitting everything for grading.
